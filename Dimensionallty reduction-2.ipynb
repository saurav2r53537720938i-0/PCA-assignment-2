    "Projection in the context of principal components analysis(PCA) refers to the process of transforming data onto a lower-dimnsional subspace.In Pca this involve finding a set of orthogonal axes onto which the data is projected retaning the maxium variance.The projection of the orginal data onto these principal components effectively reducesbthe dimesnionally components effectively of the data while prseving as much of the orginal information as possible.This reduction in dimensionally can help in visulization data compression and feature extraction.Mathematically the projection of a data point onto a principal components is simply the dot product of data point with the principal compoment is simply the dot product of the data point with the principal components vector the resulting coordinates reprsent the location of the data point in the reduced dimensional space defined by the principal components"

    "The optimization problemb in principal component anylysis(PCA) aims to find the direction along whuch the data varies the most this is acheived by maximizing the variance of the projected data points onto these direction.Formally the optmization problemb in PCA can be stated as follow.Given a datset with data point dimensional subspace onto which total variance of the projected data is maximized this is acheived by finding the orthgonal unit vector that maximize from orginal data points to their projections onto these vector . Mathematically the optimization poblebs can be formulated as findingg the eigenvectors of the covaraiance matrix of the data specficallyy the "
